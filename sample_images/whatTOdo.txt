🧠 Why Include Sample Results

Even if your numeric metrics (CER/WER) are average, sample outputs visually prove that your pipeline actually works.
Faculty and evaluators look for:

Visual examples of detected text regions

Predicted vs. actual recognition output

Improvement after preprocessing (CLAHE / Highboost)

Common error patterns

These make your results section convincing and easy to understand.

🖼️ What to Include

Since you’re focusing on Bengali OCR, skip English samples — it’s better to show strength in your trained domain.

🔹 Detection Samples

Show 2–3 examples (side by side):

Input Image	Detected Text Boxes (Original)	Detected Text Boxes (CLAHE)	Detected Text Boxes (Highboost)

Use bounding boxes or masks from each detection variant.

You can clearly visualize how CLAHE/Highboost improve text region clarity or detection count.

🔹 Recognition Samples

Show 4–6 examples (grid format):

Cropped Text Image	Ground Truth	Predicted Text	Confidence	CER/WER

Include:

2–3 correct predictions (clean Bengali words)

2–3 incorrect ones (to show where model struggles, e.g., similar-looking characters or low contrast)

💡 Tip: Add a small note under each image like:

“Model confused ‘ণ’ with ‘ন’ due to handwriting variation.”

That shows strong analytical insight.

🔹 Optional Combined Pipeline Example

Show one full image → detection → recognition → final output example:

Input document → detected text boxes → cropped → recognized text result.

This visualizes your complete OCR pipeline in one figure — it’s great for the first page of your Results section.
